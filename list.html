<h3>Memes can be accessed by appending the file name (INCLUDING FORMAT!!) to the link "springle-dobler-4000.github.io/memes/". For example, if I wanted to access "the_rides.mp4", I would go to "springle-dobler-4000.github.io/memes/the_rides.mp4".


<p>the last 2 were alex_jones.mp4 and swordfighting.mp4 but they were at the bottom of the list and i couldnt bother to take a picture of them because it's only 2 files anyway</p>



<p>Right now this is just a static webpage, but i want to make it adjust automatically. Until i learn how to do that, this is a static page updated manually</p>
